#Q1:Should RG stick to current ad design, or switch to the alternative?


#Ans:
#RG should switch to the alternative ad design (ad group 2)
#Compared to adgroup 1(base group in rest_lm2 linear model),the estimate value of ad group 2 is positive with a value of 7.866 and is significant. This means that reservations in adgroup 2 is 7.866 more than that of adgroup 1.
#(Here, the outcome variable is chosen as reservations because the conversions  are more important than the page views and call enquiries.)


##Q2:Which outcome variable is most useful to consider? Are there other outcome variables that may be useful to measure

#Ans:
#The most useful outcome variable to consider is reservations
#The other outcome variables that may be be useful to measure could be page views and calls; but these would be more important for brand awareness. For profits and conversions, reservations would be a good outcome variable.

##Question 3): Which add design is better for independent restaurants?

#Choosing the interaction terms for better understanding
rest_lm3_interactions<-lm(reservations~pageviews+calls+restaurant_type*treatment,data=rest_bid_rem)
